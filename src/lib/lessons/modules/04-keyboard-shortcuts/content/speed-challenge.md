You've learned all the essential keyboard shortcuts. Now it's time to put them to the test. This lesson presents a series of command tasks designed to exercise every shortcut you've practiced. Complete all the goals to prove your terminal navigation skills.

Here's a quick reference card of everything you've learned:

```bash
── Movement ──────────────────────────────────
Ctrl+A / Home     Jump to start of line
Ctrl+E / End      Jump to end of line
Alt+F / Alt+Right Move forward one word
Alt+B / Alt+Left  Move backward one word

── Deletion ──────────────────────────────────
Ctrl+W            Delete word before cursor
Ctrl+U            Clear to start of line
Ctrl+K            Clear to end of line
Ctrl+Y            Paste last deleted text

── History ───────────────────────────────────
Up/Down           Navigate command history
Ctrl+R            Reverse search history
!!                Repeat last command
!$                Last argument of previous command

── Control ───────────────────────────────────
Ctrl+C            Cancel / interrupt
Ctrl+L            Clear screen
Ctrl+D            EOF / exit
Ctrl+Z            Suspend process
```

Complete these four tasks as quickly as you can. Use shortcuts between commands to build speed.

**Task 1:** List what's inside the `logs` directory (with details).

**Task 2:** Read the error log at `logs/error.log`.

**Task 3:** Display the deploy script at `scripts/deploy.sh`.

**Task 4:** Print the phrase `keyboard shortcuts mastered`.

> [!TIP]
> Speed comes from not thinking about the shortcuts. If you had to pause and remember which key to press, that's normal — keep practicing and they'll become automatic. Most developers reach this point after about a week of deliberate use.
